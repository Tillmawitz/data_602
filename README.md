# DATA 602 - Advanced Programming Techniques

Course work, discussions, and assignments for the CUNY SPS Master's course. This class focussed heavily on building skills in Python programming in contrast with other courses in the program which focus on R. Most of the assignments are relatively simple for those already familiar with Python with the two projects of note being:

1. [Assignment_7.ipynb](Assignment_7.ipynb) - NYC Vehicle Collision Analysis
    An analysis of data from the NYC Open Data project designed to meet the requirements of the assignment. The notebook includes some basic data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis with accompanying commentary
2. [The Final Project](final/Tillmawitz_602_final.ipynb) - An Analysis of Snowfall in the Blue River Basin
    A research project on changes in snowfall totals over the last 130 years in the Blue River Basin, a major source of water for the city of Denver as well as the home of some of the most popular ski resorts in the world such as Vail, Breckinridge, and Copper Mountain. The project deals with missing and imperfect data, cleaning, analysis, and includes extensive commentary and analysis. The slides used for the presentation component can be found in the same folder.

# Q4. Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room
# numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The program should also create a
# dictionary containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach each
# course. After that, the program should let the user enter a course number, then it should
# display the courseâ€™s room number, instructor, and meeting time.
